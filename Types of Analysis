Q1. What is univariate analysis ?
A1. Univariate analysis is a type of data analysis that focuses on one variable at a time.

🔍 Purpose:
To understand the basic characteristics of that single variable — like its distribution, central tendency (mean, median, mode), 
spread (range, variance, standard deviation), and outliers.

✅ Example:
Suppose you have a dataset of student marks:

marks = [50, 60, 65, 70, 80, 90, 100]
Univariate analysis on marks may include:
 Mean = 73.57
 Median = 70
 Mode = No repeated value
 Standard Deviation = Measure of how spread out the values are
 Histogram to visualize the distribution of marks

*In Short* 
Univariate analysis = analyzing one column (or feature) at a time from your dataset.

Q2. what is bivariate Analysis ?
A2. 🔄 Bivariate analysis = analyzing two variables (columns) at the same time to find relationships or patterns between them.

🔍 Purpose:
To answer questions like:

* Is there a correlation between Age and Salary?

* How does Gender affect Purchase Amount?

* Does Study Time affect Exam Score?

⚡ In short:
"Bivariate" = Two variables, analyzed together to understand how they interact.

Q3. what is numrical analysis?
A3. Numerical analysis (in the context of data) refers to analyzing numeric data — that means columns (features) that contain numbers like age, salary, 
marks, temperature, etc.

🎯 Goal:
To understand the behavior, distribution, trends, and relationships of numeric variables.

💬 In short:
Numerical analysis = Analyzing number-type columns to understand data patterns, variation, and trends.
