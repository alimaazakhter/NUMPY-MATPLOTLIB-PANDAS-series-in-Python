# NUMPY-Matplotlib-PANDAS-series-in-Python
Welcome to this Repository , I started posting Numpy logical mathematical programs and Pandas programs in this Repo about arrays (Metrices), slicing of arrays and all. Go and view them all for better understanding. Also about Numpy and Matplotlib Libraries.

What is NumPy? 🤔
NumPy (Numerical Python) is a Python library used for working with numbers and data efficiently. It is mainly used for mathematical calculations, data analysis, and handling large datasets in Python.

Why Use NumPy?
1. It helps in performing fast calculations (much faster than normal Python lists).
2. It provides arrays (like lists but more powerful and faster).
3. It has many built-in mathematical functions (like mean, sum, square root, etc.).
4. It is used in Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI.

Key Features of NumPy:
1️⃣ NumPy Arrays (like lists but better)
2️⃣ Fast Mathematical Operations
3️⃣ Useful Functions (sum, mean, standard deviation, etc.)
4️⃣ Support for Large Datasets

Q1 What is Matplotlib?
-> Matplotlib is a 2D plotting library that allows you to generate different types of visualizations like:

- Line plots
- Bar charts
- Histograms
- Scatter plots
- Box plots
- Pie charts, and more!
It works well with NumPy, Pandas, and other data science libraries.

Q2 Why Use Matplotlib?
-> 
✅ Easy to Use – Simple syntax for making basic and advanced plots.
✅ Highly Customizable – You can change colors, labels, titles, and more.
✅ Works with Other Libraries – Used with Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, etc.
✅ Useful for Data Analysis – Helps in visualizing patterns and trends in data.

Q1 What is Pandas in Python? 🐼
-> Pandas is a Python library used for data analysis and manipulation. It helps you work with tables (rows & columns) like Excel or SQL.

Why Use Pandas?
✅ Read & write Excel, CSV, JSON, SQL files
✅ Clean & filter data easily
✅ Perform data analysis (sum, mean, count, etc.)
✅ Handle missing data
✅ Work with big datasets quickly
