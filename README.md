# NUMPY-and-PANDAS-series-in-Python
Welcome to this Repository , I started posting Numpy logical mathematical programs and Pandas programs in this Repo about arrays (Metrices), slicing of arrays and all. Go and view them all for better understanding.

What is NumPy? ü§î
NumPy (Numerical Python) is a Python library used for working with numbers and data efficiently. It is mainly used for mathematical calculations, data analysis, and handling large datasets in Python.

Why Use NumPy?
1. It helps in performing fast calculations (much faster than normal Python lists).
2. It provides arrays (like lists but more powerful and faster).
3. It has many built-in mathematical functions (like mean, sum, square root, etc.).
4. It is used in Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI.

Key Features of NumPy:
1Ô∏è‚É£ NumPy Arrays (like lists but better)
2Ô∏è‚É£ Fast Mathematical Operations
3Ô∏è‚É£ Useful Functions (sum, mean, standard deviation, etc.)
4Ô∏è‚É£ Support for Large Datasets

What is Pandas in Python? üêº
Pandas is a Python library used for data analysis and manipulation. It helps you work with tables (rows & columns) like Excel or SQL.

Why Use Pandas?
‚úÖ Read & write Excel, CSV, JSON, SQL files
‚úÖ Clean & filter data easily
‚úÖ Perform data analysis (sum, mean, count, etc.)
‚úÖ Handle missing data
‚úÖ Work with big datasets quickly
