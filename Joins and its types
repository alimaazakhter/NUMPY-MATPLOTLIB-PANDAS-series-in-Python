Q.1 Types of JOINS.

1. LeftJoin -> A LEFT JOIN returns all records from the left table and only the matching records from the right table. 
   If there is no match, it returns NULL for the right table's columns.

Eg :- print(pd.merge(left = df1, right = df2, on="Emp ID", how="left")).

2. RightJoin -> A RIGHT JOIN returns all records from the right table and only the matching records from the left table. 
  If there is no match, it returns NULL for the left table's columns.

Eg :- print(pd.merge(left = df1, right = df2, on="Emp ID", how="right")).

3. Inner Join -> In an INNER JOIN, you get only the common values (matching records) from both tables based on the specified condition.
  If a row from either table doesn’t have a match in the other table, it won’t be included in the result.

Eg :- print(pd.merge(left = df1, right = df2, on="Emp ID", how="inner")).
